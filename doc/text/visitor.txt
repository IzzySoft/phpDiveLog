[title]
Navigation tab: Logbook mode

[text]
Using the navigation tabs, you can navigate through the sections of the
application. The navigation bar has different elements, depending on the
"mode" of the application which you can switch with the first icon. phpDiveLog
has two modes of operation: the "Logbook" mode, and the "Global" mode. If you
don't find a single icon without description as the first element in the
navigation bar, the website administrator may have disabled the "Global" mode,
or none of the divers has opened his data for public access. Otherwise, you
can use that single first icon to switch between the modi.

[text]
In the "Logbook" mode, following tabs are available to the visitor:

<table class="nav" align="center" border="0" width="90%">
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>Dives</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">This tab brings you to the dive index, which is
     most probably the page you see first when coming to this site. The dive
     index list up all dives of the given buddy and provides you with links
     to the details, which is why we call this page "dive list", too.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>Stats</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">Here you will find some statistics for the selected
     dive logbook.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>Sites</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">Brings you to a list of all sites listed in this
     DiveLog. As with the "Dives", this list provides links to more details
     (see below).</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>&lt;BuddyName&gt;</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">If this tab is available, the owner of the selected
     logbook provides some personal details you can browse here.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>Prefs</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">Your (the visitors) preferences for this application.
     Here you can define the look-and-feel for this site (well, up to some
     degree ;) and chose the language you prefer the information in.</td></tr>
</table>

# ===========================================================================
[title]
Navigation tab: Global mode

[text]
If the admin of this site decided to enable the global mode, you can switch here
by clicking on the first single icon in the navigation bar (see above). Then,
the navigation bar will contain the following items:

<table class="nav" align="center" border="0" width="90%">
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>Divers</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">This opens a list of all divers registered with this
     site, who decided to open their DiveLogs to the public. Links to their
     logbooks are provided.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>Sites</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">Brings you to a global list of all public available
     divesite descriptions, collected from all DiveLogs of the site.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>Prefs</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">Your site preferences, as described above.</td></tr>
</table>

# ===========================================================================
[title]
Dive Index

[text]
The dive index lists up a summary of all dives recorded in the current logbook.
To make this page more handy, the site andministrator and/or the logbook owner
may have limited the count of dives displayed on one page. In this case, the
table header provides you with links to the first/last and previous/next page.

[text]
Each data row in the table represents one dive record and provides you with
the following links:
<ul>
 <li>First column (with the dive number) links to the dive details. In the last
     column, an icon indicates that there are images linked with the details.</li>
 <li>The dive location links to a list of all dive sites for this location
     that are recorded in any of the public logbooks of this installation</li>
 <li>The dive site itself links to details about the dive site</li>
 <li>The footer of the page contains a link to the phpDiveLog homepage ;)</li>
</ul>

[text]
Using the little "Up" and "Down" arrows next to the column names, you can sort
the list by that column, either ascending (up) or descending (down). If one of
these two is "greyed out" this indicates you are just sorted by this column in
this order.

# ===========================================================================
[title]
Dive Details

[text]
As the name suggests, this page gives you the details on the selected dive.
Depending on the information the diver (not) recorded, some of the following
items may be missing:
<ul>
 <li>Conditions: wheather, currents etc.</li>
 <li>Equipment used</li>
 <li>Graphic of the dive profile</li>
 <li>Divers notes on this dive</li>
 <li>Foto collection</li>
</ul>

[text]
The fotos may be thumbnails which are linked to images with a higher resolution,
and the description itself may contain links to further information. Both will
normally open in a new browser window, unless the logbook owner explicitely
defined it otherwise.

# ===========================================================================
[title]
Site Index

[text]
Here are all divesites from the current logbook listed. Navigation is the same
as with the Dive Index, and the icon in the last column is the indicator of
associated images here as well. The only link provided here is the site ID in
the first column, which brings you to the details page for the selected site.

# ===========================================================================
[title]
Site Details

[text]
Here you find the details for the selected divesite. This may include some
general geographic information, additional notes and a foto collection - if the
the logbook owner provided these details. For the images and links applies the
same as described with the dive details.

[text]
If the diver provided the GPS data for this site, a click on the globe next
to the sites name will open a new browser window. In that window you will then
find a map with the dive sites position marked - which may be useful to plan
your own dives here.

# ===========================================================================
[title]
Prefs

[text]
On the preferences page, you may set up how phpDiveLog will present you the
data. This setup includes the selection of a template set ("Skin"), and your
favorite language. The latter one is used for the item names; the divers
information will not be translated. Except if (s)he provided special information
for the selected language, which is possible for the dive and divesite notes.

# ===========================================================================
[title]
Global: Divers

[text]
This page lists up all publically available DiveLogs for this installation. A
click on the divers nick name brings you to the Dive Index of his/her logbook.
If you find an icon in the last column, this indicates that there's a personal
picture available on his/her personal page.

# ===========================================================================
[title]
Global Site Index

[text]
When you select this tab, it will bring you to a list of locations gathered
from all public logbooks on this installation. The header of the table provides
you with links to navigate between the pages, if there are multiple pages
available. A click on the locations name brings you to the list of all sites
at that location - how many sites you can expect on that page is told by the
column next to the location.

[text]
When you have selected the location to browse, the next table lists you all
sites found with this installation together with the information, in which
divers logbook we found the sites. In order to view the site description
details, just click the nick name of the diver.
