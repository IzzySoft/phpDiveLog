What is phpDiveLog?

[text]
phpDiveLog displays the information of your Aqua DiveLog LogBook based on CSV
files you generate with the Java Conduit shipped with Aqua DiveLog. Providing
some "magics" it allows you to combine these data with additional information,
such as pictures or other external data sources.

[text]
As for now, phpDiveLog offers you no features to edit these data. But it
provides you with 3 tabs to display...<ul>
<li><b>...the DiveLogBook</b>. Here you browse through the list of your dives
  (in the config file, you may specify how many entries should be displayed per
  page). For detailed information, a click on the dive# brings you directly to
  the log books entry.</li>
<li><b>...the Dive Statistics</b>, which show you some basic stats about your
  dives, such as max/avg depth and divetime etc.</li>
<li><b>...the Dive Sites Information</b>, which provides you with a list of your
  dive sites. Again, a click on the site# brings you to the details page</li></ul>

[title]
Requirements

[text]
For data conversion from Aqua DiveLog you neet to have a Java interpreter
installed (refer to the <a href="http://www.aquadivelog.org/docs/index.html"
target="_blank">Aqua DiveLog documentation</a> for details). phpDiveLog itself
only requires a running web server with PHP support (PHP5 recommended, though
PHP4 may work as well).
