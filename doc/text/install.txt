Aqua DiveLog AddOns

[text]
<b>Installation:</b><ul>
<li>copy the contents of the <code>install/adl/template/</code> dir to ADLs
    <code>template/</code> dir</li>
<li>copy the contents of the <code>install/adl/</code> dir to ADLs directory</li>

[text]
<b>Conduit configuration:</b><br>
This takes place in the <code>divelog.ini</code> file as described in the Aqua
DiveLog <a href="http://www.aquadivelog.org/docs/index.html"
target="_blank">documentation</a> (see there for detailed description). In this
little document I will assume that you installed the AddOns provided with this
archive as described above and only change the following parameters in the
<code>divelog.ini</code> file:<ul>
<li><code>TablePDBFile&nbsp;</code>: location and name of your
    <code>AquaPalm-TableDB.pdb</code> file</li>
<li><code>DivePDBFile&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>: location and name of your
    <code>AquaPalm-DiveDB.pdb</code> file</li></ul>
[text]
I will not explain all combinations of the other parameters - this is covered by
above mentioned ADL documentation and not the topic of this short documentation,
which is to get you started quick. If you want/need to change more, you will
have to find out yourself ;)

#===[ Data Transfer ]====================================[ Data Transfer ]===
[title]
Data transfer: Configuring the <code>divelog_conduit.sh</code>

[text]
The script is to be configured in the <code>divelog_conduit.sh</code> itself.
In the head of the file you find the configuration section: Even if you are not
familiar with Shell scripts, it should be easy for you to set up. One hint:
never place spaces around the "=" sign or it will not work. The following
options will need your attention:
[text]
<table class="nav" align="center" border="0" width="90%">
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>PALMLOCALE</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">Don't mess this up with your PCs locale settings - we
   don't touch them. But if they differ from your Palms locale (which will
   certainly be the case if you run SuSE 9.1 or higher with UTF-8 locale),
   special characters may get messed up or, in the worst case, the Java
   Conduit hangs if this is not set correctly. In most cases, the setting of
   <code>de_DE@euro</code> (Latin-1 plus Euro sign) will be the correct choice.
   For non-Western charsets on your Palm, you may have to experiment a bit
   until all special chars are drawn correctly.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>RECODEFROM</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">PalmOS devices use different character sets. If you
   encounter display problems on your divelog web pages, such as messed-up
   characters (German Umlauts and the like), you may want to play with this
   option. If not set to an empty string, the script will use the <code>recode</code>
   command to convert the character set to UTF8 - you just need to figure out
   which character set your PalmOS device is using (see also <code>install/charsets.txt</code>).
   Usually, a good starting point is <code>lat1</code> for newer devices (PalmOS
   5 and up), or <code>cp1252</code> for older ones (PalmOS 4 and lower).</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>LOGDIR</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">if you followed my advice for the <code>divelog.ini</code>
   configuration above, you can leave it as is. If not: this value has to match
   the <code>LogBookPath</code> in the <code>divelog.ini</code></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>UNITS</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">which kind of units you prefer - can be set either to
   "metric", "imperial" or "bothunits"</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>PROFUPD</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">Creation of the dive profile PNG graphics slows down
   the conversion process a lot (it takes about 2/3 of the time). Luckily,
   starting with conduit version 0.99_7 there is a new parameter to skip
   this step if the PNG already exists: <code>-noprofileupdate</code>. In
   case you are using an older conduit version, just comment out that line
   in your config - or better get the latest conduit ;)</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>DATEFORMAT</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">just for the "progress display" on the screen to give you an
   idea how long which step took ;)</td></tr>
 <tr><td colspan=2 class="td_blank" align="center"><b>Local Transfers</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>USELOCAL</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">if you want to copy the files to your local webserver,
   set the value to "1" - otherwise to "0".</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>PDLBASE</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">the divers directory of your <b><i>local</i></b>
   phpDiveLog installation, i.e. where the subdirectories <code>data/</code>
   and <code>images/</code> reside. Will certainly look like <code>&lt;PDL root
   dir&gt;/diver/&lt;nickname&gt;</code> - see "Set up a diver" on the
   {admin_page} page for details.</td></tr>
 <tr><td colspan=2 class="td_blank" align="center"><b>Remote Transfers</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>USESCP</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">if you want to copy the files to a remote webserver via
   SCP, set the value to "1"; if you have <code>rsync</code> installed on both
   the client and the server, you will prefer "2" for a) faster and b) complete
   sync (including all your additional texts and fotos). For no transfers to
   any remote server, set this to "0".</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>SCPBASE</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">the divers directory of the <b><i>remote</i></b>
   phpDiveLog installation, i.e. where the subdirectories <code>data/</code>
   and <code>images/</code> on the remote server reside. Will certainly look like
   <code>&lt;nickname&gt;@www.domain.com:/&lt;PDL root dir&gt;/diver/&lt;nickname&gt;</code>,
   where &lt;PDL root dir&gt; is the base directory of the PDL webtree or, if
   the "single OS user transfer" is used, the home directory of that OS user
   - see "Set up a diver" on the {admin_page} page for details.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>RSYNCBASE</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">this defines which source directory should be used with
   <code>rsync</code>. If you have no local PDL installation on your machine
   and/or use <code>USESCP=0</code>, set this to "2" which advises the script
   to use the ADL log dir as source. In this case, also make sure that all
   needed subdirectories (i.e. for the fotos, notes and texts) exist at that
   place! Otherwise, with a local installation of PDL, you probably don't want
   to keep all fotos duplicate, so set this to "1" and place all your additional
   foto and text files where they belong: in your local PDL diver dir. With
   this setting, you will need to set <code>USELOCAL=1</code>.</td></tr>
</table>
[text]
You can use local (<code>USELOCAL=1</code>) and remote (<code>USESCP=1</code>
or <code>USESCP=2</code>) transfers independantly - if you need both, you can
enable both at the same time (which would even be required for
<code>RSYNCBASE=1</code>).

#===[ phpDiveLog ]==========================================[ phpDiveLog ]===
[title]
phpDiveLog: Installation

[text]
<ol>
 <li>copy everything except the <code>install/</code> subdir into your web tree</li>
 <li>if you don't want to start with the demo data, remove all files from the
     <code>data/</code> , <code>fotos/</code> and <code>images/</code> subdir</li>
</ol>

[text]
If you plan to use the data transfer for all divers with just one OS user, you
need to create this user on your OS. On *nix Systems (Unix, Linux, etc.), this
should work like this:

[text]
<ol>
 <li>Become root (<code>su -</code>)</li>
 <li>To create the user, run 
     <code>useradd -g &lt;webgroup&gt; -m -c "phpDiveLog transfers user" &lt;user&gt;</code>.
     Replace &lt;webgroup&gt; with the group your web server is using (it needs
     at least read access here), and &lt;user&gt; with the username you wish to
     use for this.</li>
 <li>Set a OS password for this user: <code>passwd &lt;user&gt;</code></li>
 <li>Below the users homedir, create a directory for the divers data:
     <code>mkdir /home/&lt;user&gt;/transfer</code></li>
 <li>Make sure the group has read access to the transfer directory (and ALL
     directories/files contained - this step you may need to repeat for each
     diver you set up here later): <code>chmod -R g+w /home/&lt;user&gt;/transfer</code></li>
</ol>
This account info will be needed for the PDL config on your server, plus for
the setup of the conduit wrapper script on the divers client.

#---[ Configuration ]------------------------------------[ Configuration ]---
[title]
phpDiveLog: Konfiguration

[text]
All the "user-based" configuration takes place in the <code>inc/config.inc</code>
file. I strongly recommend not to try some configuration in other places (which
would make it harder for YOU to update your installation later) - if you miss
some configuration option, just let me know and I will see if and how I can
implement this.

[text]
Each configuration option is documented within the config file, so
"QuickStarters" can skip here to the next section. For all others: here comes
a short documentation for the available parameters and their effects:
[text]
<table class="nav" align="center" border="0" width="90%">
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$database["type"]</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">right now you can set this to "csv" only. In the future,
    there may be more formats available, such as UDDF for the Universal Dive
    Data Format (again a file), or even "real databases" such as MySQL,
    PostgreSQL, etc.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$display_limit</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">with pages containing lists, as e.g. the sitelist, this
    value will advise PDL how many entries (i.e. table data rows) to display per
    page. This saves you from scrolling through long pages - but of course you
    can set this to e.g. 999999999 and everything will fit on one page (but not
    necessarily one screen).</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$template_set</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">to which template set PDL should default. Right now the
    values "aqua" and "default" are available. The visitor can overwrite this
    value (for his/her browser session only, of course) by selecting a different
    template set on the preferences page.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$lang</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">the default language to use. This is a 2 character ISO
    code, like "en" for English or "de" for German. You can set this to any
    language you like - if no translations are found, PDL will fall back to
    English. Of course you can create your own translations, which is discussed
    on the {admin_page} page.<br>
    Before you get confused when seeing a different language - here is how
    phpDiveLog deals with languages:<OL>
    <LI>Check the URL for an explicitly requested language (<code>?lang=XX</CODE>)</LI>
    <LI>If there is none (or the requested one is not available), check the
        browsers negotiated language</LI>
    <LI>If we still found no match, use the one defined here</LI></OL></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$title</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">for now the site name to be displayed in the browsers
    title bar. At the end of this, some page information will be added: if you
    e.g. set the <code>title</code> to "MyDiveLog", by browsing the dive #5 the
    browsers title probably looks like "MyDiveLog: Dive# 5" - where "Dive"
    could be localized even...</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$enable_index</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">whether visitors should be allowed to browse the
    buddylist. Needs to be set to "TRUE" if you want to use
    <code>$default_page="index"</code> (see below).</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$default_page</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">what to do if there's no diver specified with the URL
    (and thus PDL does not know where to look for the data - normally this has
    to be done on the URL with the <code>diver=nickname</code> parameter)? The
    options are:<ul style="margin-top:0;">
      <li>"user"  - we have a default user (see <code>$default_user</code>)</li>
      <li>"index" - display the index page with available nicks (needs
          <code>enable_index</code> to be set to TRUE - see above)</li>
      <li>"error" - display an error message to the visitor</li></ul></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$default_user</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">only evaluated if <code>$default_page="user"</code>:
    which is the default logbook we should route the request to? Must be a
    valid account (see "set up a diver"), otherwise results in
    <code>$default_page="error"</code>.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$sitepix_on_divepage</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">if you want pictures from the corresponding dive site to
    be displayed together with the pictures from the dive when viewing the
    dive page, set this to 1.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$use_dyn_profile_png</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">Though the Aqua DiveLog Conduit creates graph images
    for the dive profiles, these images vary much in their dimensions. To keep
    the design more clear, you may want to generate these profiles dynamically
    by setting this option to "1". Note that this requires GD support in your
    PHP installation - plus a directory named <code>profiles</code> in each
    divers home, writable for the web server process. The image then will be
    generated in two cases: If it does not already exist, or if the profile CSV
    file is newer.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$values_in_statgraphs</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">On the statistics page for each diver you also find some
    graphs, e.g. for dives per year. They can have the values printed within the
    bars - but if you are to list up statistics for more than 20 years, or have
    several hundreds (or even more) dives per year, this may not look as nice as
    you would expect - so you have the choice to: always have the values displayed
    in the bars ("yes"), never have them there ("no"), or let the app decide
    ("auto"). The latter should be fine for the average diver.<br>
    Note: The values are always displayed when hovering the mouse over the
    corresponding bar - so don't be afraid they could be completely missing.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$allow_override</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">some configuration values can be defined on a
    per-logbook-base, so each diver can provide his/her default preferences to
    it. We do not want them to mess up things, so here we define which
    parameters may be overridden by the <code>diver/*/system.conf</code> file.
    The value of this parameter is a space separated list of options. As shipped,
    these is set to "title lang display_limit template_set userdef1 userdef2",
    which seems to me being a good choice.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$pwdfile</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">If you want to allow your buddies to transfer their
    divelog data using a single OS account, you need to set up a password
    file (so only the diver him-/herself can import their transfered data
    into the PDL installation). This file should NOT reside inside your
    web tree, but it must be readable by the web server. A good idea is to
    let this file be owned by the web servers users group, and apply read
    permission for the group. The web server should not have write permission
    to the file.</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$transfer_dir</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">The base directory for the transfered logbook data when
    using the "single OS user transfer". This should be the directory containing
    the diver directories directly below it (i.e. the counterpart to the PDL
    <code>diver/</code> directory - also see the {admin_page} for this).</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$mapsite</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">If you recorded GPS coordinates with your dive sites,
    phpDiveLog creates a link to a given mapsite to look up the place. You
    may chose between "Mapquest" and "Google" (the latter refers, of course,
    to <i>Google Maps</i>)</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b><code>$logbook_default_sort</code></b></td>
  <td class="td_blank" rowspan="4">These are the default sort settings if one
    enters the logbook resp. sitelist first time on the visit, and did not yet
    apply a custom sort (i.e. did not yet click one of the up/down arrows next
    to the column names). The <code>*_order</code> can be either "asc" or
    "desc". For the <code>*_sort</code> are the following values valid:<ul>
    <li>logbook: date, time, location, place, rating, depth, buddy</li>

[title]
phpDiveLog: Updating

[text]
When updating, you generally follow the steps above (replacing the files with
the updates, check the configuration). A good idea for a clean installation
would be deleting all but the <code>diver/</code> dir (after a backup) and
installing the new files then, followed by a check of the <code>inc/config.inc</code>
file which may contain some new options.

[eof]
