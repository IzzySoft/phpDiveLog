#============================================================[ Diver Setup ]===
[title]
Set up a diver

[text]
All data now are located in the divers directory. This is a kind of "home
directory" located below the diver/ directory. In order to set up an account,
just create a new directory here with a name of your choice - a good
recommendation would be the divers nick name in lower case. This "home
directory" then must have the following subdirectory structure (compare with
the <code>diver/demo/</code> directory structure):<ul>
<pre>
  -+ data     (holding the *.csv data files)
   + fotos
   | + dive   (fotos of the dives)
   | + site   (fotos of the dive sites)
   + images   (dive profiles generated by ADL are placed here)
   + profiles (dynamically generated dive profile graphs)
</pre>

[text]
If the diver wants his account to be listed with the buddylist, just put a file
named <code>public</code> in his homedir. If that file is missing, the account
will be treated as "privat", i.e. it is only accessible if one invokes PDL with
the correct <code>diver=&lt;nickname&gt;</code> parameter.

[text]
If you want to use the dynamically generated profile graphs and/or the graphs on
the statistics page, make sure your web server process has read <i>and</i> write
permission to the <code>profiles</code> directory in each divers home.

[text]
For more detailed information on the configuration of a divers account, please
refer to the {diver_page}.

#======================================================[ Multi-User issues ]===
[title]
The web page - multi user issues

[text]
If you now point your browser to the PDL start page, it needs to know whose
data you requested. This is done by adding the parameter
<code>diver=&lt;nickname&gt;</code> to the URL, so it would e.g. look like
"http://localhost/divelog/index.php?diver=zorro" for the divelog of zorro
(assuming, you created a divers account for "zorro" as described in the
installation instructions).

[text]
What happens if you ommit that parameter? PDL then does not know whose divelog
you want to browse. Depending on the setting of <code>$default_page</code> in
your <code>inc/config.inc</code> file, this leads to one of the following
results:
[text]
<table class="nav" align="center" border="0" style="width:90%">
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>error</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">an error message is displayed to the visitor informing
    him/her about the problem and how to solve it (i.e. include the
    <code>diver=</code> parameter in the URL)</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>index</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">PDL will display a list of available DiveLogs. This requires
   the parameter <code>$enable_index</code> to be set to TRUE. The created list
   will only contain PUBLIC DiveLogs, i.e. those where the diver has put the
   file named <code>public</code> into his/her "home directory".</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>user</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">PDL will display the data of the user specified by the
   <code>$default_user</code> setting in your <code>inc/config.inc</code>.</td></tr></table>
[text]
This way you can set up PDL to always display your own divelog by default
(useful e.g. for single user installation) by just setting the
<code>$default_user</code> to your nick name used with PDL.

#==========================================================[ Data Transfer ]===
[title]
Preparing data transfer using a single OS user for all divers

[text]
If you intend to let your diver buddies transfer their data using the "single
OS user transfer" (see {install_page}), these directories must be writeable by
the web server process. The easiest way to reach this goal is to have them
owned by the web server(s group) and then set the write permission accordingly,
e.g.:<br>
<code>chown -R wwwrun.www diver/demo<br>chmod -R g+w diver/demo</code><br>
This ensures that the transfer module can write the imported data here.
Everybody who needs to directly write to this directory (e.g. for local
transfers), should then be member of the "www" group.

[text]
Moreover, you will need to add this user to the password file defined in your
<code>config.inc</code> (again, only if (s)he shall be able to transfer the
logbook data using the "single OS user"). Just add a line containing the divers
nick name and the MD5 hash of his password at the end of that file in the syntax
you see there. Hint: to obtain the hash, you may e.g. use a simple PHP script
running the function <code>$pwd=md5("plain_text_pwd");</code>.

[text]
For the data transfer from the divers client, you need a directory with the
same structure as the <code>diver/</code> subdirectory. This directory needs to
be readable by the web server process, and is the one specified by
<code>$transfer_dir</code> in the <code>config.inc</code> file (also see the
{install_page} for details). Whether you need to setup a new OS user for this,
depends on the transfer methods you want to provide. With FTP, there are some
servers available that let you set up "virtual users" and map their
"home directory" to some path of your choice (e.g. Pure-FTPd). If you plan to
provide SCP/RSync, you will need an OS user for this - and preferably chroot
him to his home directory. For details on this, see your OS documentation.
