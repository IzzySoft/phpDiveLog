[title]
Localization

[text]
phpDiveLog now ships with language support for English, German and Russian. If
you want to localize it for your language: this should be very easy following
the steps described here.

[text]
The localization files are located in the <code>lang/</code> subdirectory. The
content has to be conform with the UTF-8 charset. In order to create your own
"locale file", I assume Russian here as an example, you just have to...

[text]
<ul>
<li>copy the <code>trans.en</code> file to <code>trans.ru</code> (extension is
  the ISO language code)</li>
<li>open it with your favorite text editor (preferably one supporting UTF-8).
  The file is in simple CSV format: leave the first line and first column
  untouched, and just replace the translations. If the translation would look
  the same as the original from the lang.en file, simply delete the line;
  PDL falls back to English if the translation is not found. In fact, by
  deleting the line (instead of keeping the duplicate) the application may
  slightly be sped up since the setup process is shorter ;)</li>
<li>save the file with UTF-8 encoding. If your editor does not support UTF-8,
  you need to convert the file to UTF-8 after saving it. On *nix systems you
  can use the <code>recode</code> command for it (see <code>man recode</code>
  for details).</li>
<li>now you are done: since the new <code>trans.ru</code> file resides in the
  <code>lang/</code> directory, it will be found by PDL automagically. In your
  browser, go to the preferences page - the language should show up in the list.</li></ul>

[text]
If you followed all these steps, and the language showed up but has no
"clickable area" (i.e. associated flag), you need to find an image of the
flag representing your language (size should be about 30x20 pixels) and copy
it into the <code>templates/*/images/</code> directories. For our example, the
file name had to be <code>lang_ru.jpg</code> (it MUST be a jpeg file). Some
additional flag images already exist there for the languages I hope to have
supported soon - with your help!

[text]
If you created a new language file I would appreciate to receive a copy to
be included with future releases. Please send it to {mailto}.

[title]
The web page - multi user issues

[text]
If you now point your browser to the PDL start page, it needs to know whose
data you requested. This is done by adding the parameter
<code>diver=&lt;nickname&gt;</code> to the URL, so it would e.g. look like
"http://localhost/divelog/index.php?diver=zorro" for the divelog of zorro
(assuming, you created a divers account for "zorro" as described in the
installation instructions).

[text]
What happens if you ommit that parameter? PDL then does not know whose divelog
you want to browse. Depending on the setting of <code>$default_page</code> in
your <code>inc/config.inc</code> file, this leads to one of the following
results:
[text]
<table class="nav" align="center" border="0" style="width:90%">
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>error</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">an error message is displayed to the visitor informing
    him/her about the problem and how to solve it (i.e. include the
    <code>diver=</code> parameter in the URL)</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>index</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">PDL will display a list of available DiveLogs. This requires
   the parameter <code>$enable_index</code> to be set to TRUE. The created list
   will only contain PUBLIC DiveLogs, i.e. those where the diver has put the
   file named <code>public</code> into his/her "home directory".</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="td_blank"><b>user</b></td>
  <td class="td_blank">PDL will display the data of the user specified by the
   <code>$default_user</code> setting in your <code>inc/config.inc</code>.</td></tr></table>
[text]
This way you can set up PDL to always display your own divelog by default
(useful e.g. for single user installation) by just setting the
<code>$default_user</code> to your nick name used with PDL.

Set up a diver

[text]
All data now are located in the divers directory. This is a kind of "home
directory" located below the diver/ directory. In order to set up an account,
just create a new directory here with a name of your choice - a good
recommendation would be the divers nick name in lower case. This "home
directory" then must have the following subdirectory structure (compare with
the <code>diver/demo/</code> directory structure):<ul>
<pre>
  -+ data     (holding the *.csv data files)
   + fotos
   | + dive   (fotos of the dives)
   | + site   (fotos of the dive sites)
   + images   (dive profiles generated by ADL are placed here)
</pre>

[text]
If the diver wants his account to be listed with the buddylist, just put a file
named <code>public</code> in his homedir. If that file is missing, the account
will be treated as "privat", i.e. it is only accessible if one invokes PDL with
the correct <code>diver=&lt;nickname&gt;</code> parameter.

[text]
For more detailed information on the configuration of a divers account, please
refer to the {diver_page}.
