PalmOS Supported CharacterSets
==============================

PalmOS usually only supports one character set on the device - not multiple
character sets at the same time. Supported character sets include:

 Name             	 Description                               Recode
 charEncodingAscii 	 ISO 646-1991                              ascii
 charEncodingISO8859_1 	 ISO 8859 Teil 1                           lat1
 charEncodingPalmLatin 	 Palm OS Version of CP1252
 charEncodingShiftJIS 	 Codierung for 0208-1990 + 1-Byte-katakana JIS_X0208
 charEncodingPalmSJIS 	 Palm OS Version of CP932
 charEncodingUTF8 	 Encoding for Unicode                      utf8
 charEncodingCP1252 	 Windows-Variant of 8859-1                 cp1252
 charEncodingCP932 	 Windows-Variant of ShiftJIS               cp932

Of course, if your Palm is setup to use UTF8, you don't need any recoding in the
divelog_conduit.sh to be done. Same applies to plain Ascii, since this is a
subset of UTF8. If your Palm uses one of the PalmOS specific chararacter sets
(in the table marked as "Palm OS Version of...") you may be in trouble, since
those are not directly supported by the recode command. In those cases you may
experiment with their "originals" - in the hope you have luck...
