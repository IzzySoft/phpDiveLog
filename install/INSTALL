1) Aqua DiveLog
---------------
- copy the contents of the install/adl/template/ dir to ADLs template/ dir
- copy the contents of the install/adl/ dir to ADLs directory
- adjust the DATADIR setting in the beginning of divelog_conduit.sh
- adjust the settings for TablePDBFile and DivePDBFile in both the divelog.data
  and divelog.sites files in the ADL directory

2) phpDiveLog
-------------
- copy everything except the install/ subdir into your web tree

3) Config
---------
You may want to adjust the "display limit", i.e. how many records should show
up per page in lists (i.e. for now the "Dives" and "Sites" pages). This
setting is to be found in the "preferences" block of the "inc/config.inc" file,
and is the only thing you possibly may change. Leave the other settings
untouched - right now there are no alternative settings for them ;)

If in the divelog_conduit.sh file (see above in block 1) you adjusted the
DATADIR only (and did not change any file names), and the directory structure
in your ADL installation stayed the same as shipped, no more changes have to be
made. Run the conduit script once (otherwise you have my old dive data
displayed), and enjoy!
