This README was created for phpDiveLog v0.1.0 - and last updated for v0.2.0.
Since you may know that programmers are lazy doc writers, not all points may
be up-to-date any more. In this case, please forgive (and notify) me!

Next sin: This documentation is deprecated. A more up-to-date documentation
is accessible to you after the "PDL" step in 2) when pointing your browser to
http://<PDL_URL>/doc/index.php -- where <PDL_URL> is either the place where
you unpacked the files to (see below at Nr. 2), or the PDL demo site.

 1) Requirements
 2) Installation

 4) Disclaimer


===============================================================================

1) Requirements
---------------
For data conversion from Aqua DiveLog you neet to have a Java interpreter
installed (refer to the Aqua DiveLog documentation for details).
phpDiveLog itself only requires a running web server with PHP4 support.

===============================================================================

2) Installation
---------------
This is a "Quick installation instructions" file for the impatient. More
detailed installation and configuration instructions are to be found with
your browser pointed to http://<PDL_URL>/doc/install.php after completing
the "PDL" item below:
- PDL: copy everything except the install/ subdir into your web tree and then
  check the inc/config.inc file for parameters you may want to adjust. Create
  your own diver profile by copying the diver/demo directory to
  diver/<your_nick_here>, directory structure only. This directory you should
  specify as PDLBASE in the ADL divelog_conduit.sh. Optionally set up the
  system.conf and diver.conf files in this directory.
- ADL: copy the contents of the install/adl/template/ dir to ADLs template/ dir
  and the contents of the install/adl/ dir to ADLs directory. Then adjust the
  settings for TablePDBFile and DivePDBFile in the divelog.ini, plus PDLBASE
  in the divelog_conduit.sh
- Data transfer: if both sides are configured, just run the divelog_conduit.sh
  once - then point your browser to
  http://<your_server>/<PDL_URL>/index.php?diver=<your_nick_here>

===============================================================================
