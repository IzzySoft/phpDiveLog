This README was created for phpDiveLog v0.1.0 - and since you may know that
programmers are lazy doc writers, not all points may be up-to-date any more.
In this case, please forgive (and notify) me!

===============================================================================

1) What is phpDiveLog?
----------------------
phpDiveLog displays the information of your Aqua DiveLog LogBook based on CSV
files you generate with the Java Conduit shipped with Aqua DiveLog. Due to
the restrictions of that conduit, some data need to be included statically -
plus we have to run the conduit twice to retrieve all data (since only one
CSV file is supported by the divelog.ini of v0.98). These restrictions will
be removed with the next release of Aqua DiveLog.

As for now, phpDiveLog offers you no features to edit these data. But it
provides you with 3 tabs to display...
- ...the DiveLogBook. Here you browse through the list of your dives (in the
  config file, you may specify how many entries should be displayed per page).
  For detailed information, a click on the dive# brings you directly to the log
  books entry.
- ...the Dive Statistics, which show you some basic stats about your dives,
  such as max/avg depth and divetime etc.
- ...the Dive Sites Information, which provides you with a list of your dive
  sites. Again, a click on the site# brings you to the details page

===============================================================================

2) Requirements
---------------
For data conversion from Aqua DiveLog you neet to have a Java interpreter
installed (refer to the Aqua DiveLog documentation for details).
phpDiveLog itself only requires a running web server with PHP4 support.

===============================================================================

3) Installation
---------------
See the file INSTALL (which should reside in the same directory as this file
you are reading now).

===============================================================================

4.) CopyRight (and CopyLeft)
----------------------------

This nice piece of software is (c) 2004 by Itzchak Rehberg and IzzySoft, and is
protected by the GNU Public License Version 2 (GPL). In short, this means:
- you'll have the source code available
- you may run this program on as many machines as you want/have
- you may copy and distribute it as much as you want - as long as you don't
  take money for it (and keep all files together!)
- you may edit this code to fit your needs/wishes (please, let me know about
  improvements!)
- you may use this code for own applications - but they have to be released
  under GPL then as well.
For details, please read the file named LICENSE in the doc/ directory.
If you release this program e.g. in a bundle of software on CD/DVD, release
an article about this program etc, let the author know about this. Not that
you need an explicit permission (as long as you stick to the above terms,
especially the GPL) - you are even encouraged to do so. I just want to be
informed about the fact to be up-to-date about all PR taking place ;).

===============================================================================

5) Disclaimer
-------------

This program is provided "as is" with no warranty (see GPL Par. 11).
Especially this means, that the author is not responsible for any damages
caused by the use of this software - explicitly or implicitly. The only thing
I can guarantee you is: it will consume some disk space :)

===============================================================================

6) More Information
