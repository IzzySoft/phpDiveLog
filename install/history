History for phpDiveLog
======================

v0.3.0
-------------------
+ now it is possible to optionally generate the dive profil graph dynamically
+ added dive stats graphs to statistics page. These will automatically
  be available if the directory "profiles" is available in the divers home
  *and* this directory is radable and writable by the web server process.
+ made debug logging configurable - so it's easier to collect important details

v0.2.9 (06.12.2008)
-------------------
+ added French translations (Tnx to Gilles!)
! fixed minor syntax error in KML template
+ added recoding of CSV files to UTF8 (configurable)
+ optionally, site pictures can now be included on the corresponding dive pages
! fixing PHP5 issue in global site list which caused a mess with place names
+ added links to first/last page on Global Sites Index
* parentheses in place names caused "permission problems" - permitting them now

v0.2.8 (01.01.2008)
-------------------
+ Dutch translations updated (Tnx to Robbie)
! fixed a small (but nasty) bug with the places list
+ Added KML creation to display all dive sites with Google Earth or in Google Maps
! adjusted vulnerability check to allow spaces and commata in dive place name
+ now you can decide what mapserver to use: Mapquest (as it was up to now),
  Google Maps, or Yahoo Maps. See inc/config.inc where you can do so.

v0.2.7 (01.11.2006)
-------------------
+ added sorting (by columns) to logbook and sitelist
+ added some vulnerability checks

v0.2.6 (08.11.2005)

+ added support for the user defined fields (put to equipment block)
  (configure in the divers system.conf)
+ global site list now also indicates whether site description contains photos
! picture "albums" from sites/dives sometimes did not consider alpahetic order

v0.2.5 (21.09.2004)
-------------------
* separated the configuration part from the conduit wrapper script (outsourced
  to a separate file) to a) ease updating and b) use the same config with
  multiple scripts (to come)
+ added resync.sh to update the local installation from a remote server
+ both sync scripts now accept command line params (-c for alternate config,
  plus -h for help screen)
! hopefully fixed the problem with "special characters" (e.g. German Umlauts)
  for the Java Conduit when running it on a locale different from Latin-1[5]
  (divelog_conduit.sh)
+ added data import facility for multiple divers using just one OS account

v0.2.4 (08.09.2004)
-------------------
+ updated help pages concerning localized notes
+ added help on "how to navigate phpVideoPro"
+ added tab to open help window

+ personal page now also supports the "foto collection"

v0.2.3 (05.09.2004)
-------------------
+ improved formating of included textfiles
+ added first/last buttons to the navigation in dive[site] lists
+ clicking on the location in the dives list now brings you to the (global)
  list of all divesites at this place
+ added support for language specific versions of notes files (applies to the
  dive* and site* files in the notes/ directory; just name the file e.g.
  *.txt.de for German -- but make sure, that a "default" version (*.txt) is
  available there as well). Supported are all languages PDL has translations
  installed for - at this time as shipped, these are English, German and
  Russian.

v0.2.2 (02.09.2004)
-------------------
! with RSync, some of the data have not correctly been transfered by the conduit
  wrapper
+ divelog_conduit.sh now logs the process also to a file (not screen only)
+ if there are more than 3 pictures associated with a dive[site], PDL now starts
  a new row after each third image
! GPS evaluation now also considers the case that only (decimal) grad values
  are given (and no separate minutes/seconds are available)
! maplink now handles southern and western GPS data correctly
* some code cleanup

v0.2.1 (31.08.2004)
-------------------
! fixed a syntax error in the sitelist script
+ if coordinates are given, a click on the globe in the site details opens a
  new window with a map of the area, having the given location marked
+ added support for RSync transfers to the divelog_conduit.sh script
* notesblock is now only displayed if content exists

v0.2.0 (18.08.2004)
-------------------
+ now the [url], [img]/[imgr] and [file] tags can be used in the notes fields of
  dives and sites
* updated Russian translations
+ added OnLine Documentation (English)
+ Conduit wrapper script now optionally transfers via SCP to remote web server
+ added "external note fields" for dive[site] notes (see online help in the
  "diver" section for details)

-------------------
* switch button on global pages (to reach the personal pages) is now also
  available if no diver was specified with the url, but $default_page="user"
! the global site list did not honour the enable_index option of the config.inc
! the display_limit was ignored as well when a place was selected
! still some vars missing with register_globals=off
* tuned the db_text class (PDL got very slow with large DiveLogs)

v0.1.6 (21.07.2004)
-------------------
+ for the dive and site fotos we now link to "large" pictures (open via
  JavaScript in a new window) if they exist (picture with the same name in
  the diver/*/fotos/*/large/ subdirectory)
* the "Person" tab (if available) now shows the divers nick instead of "Person"
+ added number of sites and avg dives/site to the stats page
+ added global site list to list up all places contained within the DiveLogs.
  A click then brings the visitor to a list of all DiveSites at the selected
  place, which contains links to the divers' descriptions

v0.1.5 (12.07.2004)
-------------------
+ some settings (such as display_limit, default language, etc.) can now be
  (re-)defined on a per-diver-base (i.e. each logbook can have its own defaults)
+ added "Quick installation" for the impatient to the doc/README file
+ added (optional) personal page
+ now photo can be added to personal page
+ added buddylist. You can now set $default_page="index" in your inc/config.inc
  so all calls without a given diver will result in the buddylist to be
  displayed
* some more adjustments concerning the register_globals issue (if someone has
  set register_globals=on, reports are welcome ;)

v0.1.4 (05.07.2004)
-------------------
+ prefered language is now checked via browser info, too. Priorities:
  1-user selected language (selectable on prefs page/"lang=xx" in request string)
  2-if not (1), checking browser info (http_accept_language)
  3-if not (1) and (2) found no language supported by PDL, fall back to
    default configured in inc/config.inc
* should now work regardless if register_globals is set to "on" or "off"
! fixed a bug with the headers that in some cases confused the browser
  concerning the charset to use
+ adding multi-user capabilities: now PDL can serve multiple divelogs
+ default logbook now can be defined in the inc/config.inc (in case there's
  no logbook defined by the URL containing "?diver=<nickname>")
+ if "?diver=<nickname>" is defined in the URL but no diver/<nickname>
  directory exists, this leads to a proper error message now (no tech-blabla ;)
+ added support for the "error" option of the $default_page setting in the
  inc/config.inc file

v0.1.3 (01.07.2004)
-------------------
+ added dive profile image (if available) to dive detail page
! fixed some syntax errors in the statistic template for ADL which caused
  PDLs statistic page to be messed up

  language. Just need the language files to be provided ;) For now, only
  English is available.
+ added German translations
* translation system now falls back to English if translation not found
* some code reorganization (for the tabs)
+ default language can now be set in the inc/config.inc file and will be
  overwritten by the visitors preferences (if any given)
+ added preferences tab (and page, of course ;) to allow the visitor to select
  the language and template set (S)HE likes
* made the installation instructions more detailed
* switched to UTF-8 for HTML encoding to support non-Latin1 languages
+ added documentation on localization (see install/README)
+ added Russian localization (ah, that's what we needed UTF-8 for ;)

v0.1.2 (28.06.2004)
-------------------
+ added the Aqua template set
+ dive details can now contain fotos
+ web site name (for the window title) can now be configured

  camera symbol in the dive[site] list

-------------------
+ all data are now retrieved from the (CSV) data files (thanks to the
  new conduit provided by Stephan), making the *.html files obsolete
* new conduit data providing us with the site_id now - so we use this for
  reference
+ logbook list and entry now provide direct link to dive site details
+ site list now supports the display limit setting
+ time in the schedule (if available) is now correctly formated
