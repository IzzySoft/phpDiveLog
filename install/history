History for phpDiveLog
======================

v0.1.7
-------------------
* switch button on global pages (to reach the personal pages) is now also
  available if no diver was specified with the url, but $default_page="user"
! the global site list did not honour the enable_index option of the config.inc

v0.1.6 (21.07.2004)
-------------------
+ for the dive and site fotos we now link to "large" pictures (open via
  JavaScript in a new window) if they exist (picture with the same name in
  the diver/*/fotos/*/large/ subdirectory)
* the "Person" tab (if available) now shows the divers nick instead of "Person"
+ added number of sites and avg dives/site to the stats page
+ added global site list to list up all places contained within the DiveLogs.
  A click then brings the visitor to a list of all DiveSites at the selected
  place, which contains links to the divers' descriptions

v0.1.5 (12.07.2004)
-------------------
+ some settings (such as display_limit, default language, etc.) can now be
  (re-)defined on a per-diver-base (i.e. each logbook can have its own defaults)
+ added "Quick installation" for the impatient to the doc/README file
+ added (optional) personal page
+ now photo can be added to personal page
+ added buddylist. You can now set $default_page="index" in your inc/config.inc
  so all calls without a given diver will result in the buddylist to be
  displayed
* some more adjustments concerning the register_globals issue (if someone has
  set register_globals=on, reports are welcome ;)

v0.1.4 (05.07.2004)
-------------------
+ prefered language is now checked via browser info, too. Priorities:
  1-user selected language (selectable on prefs page/"lang=xx" in request string)
  2-if not (1), checking browser info (http_accept_language)
  3-if not (1) and (2) found no language supported by PDL, fall back to
    default configured in inc/config.inc
* should now work regardless if register_globals is set to "on" or "off"
! fixed a bug with the headers that in some cases confused the browser
  concerning the charset to use
+ adding multi-user capabilities: now PDL can serve multiple divelogs
+ default logbook now can be defined in the inc/config.inc (in case there's
  no logbook defined by the URL containing "?diver=<nickname>")
+ if "?diver=<nickname>" is defined in the URL but no diver/<nickname>
  directory exists, this leads to a proper error message now (no tech-blabla ;)
+ added support for the "error" option of the $default_page setting in the
  inc/config.inc file

v0.1.3 (01.07.2004)
-------------------
+ added dive profile image (if available) to dive detail page
! fixed some syntax errors in the statistic template for ADL which caused
  PDLs statistic page to be messed up
+ added translation system - thus PDL now is prepared to display in "any"
  language. Just need the language files to be provided ;) For now, only
  English is available.
+ added German translations
* translation system now falls back to English if translation not found
* some code reorganization (for the tabs)
+ default language can now be set in the inc/config.inc file and will be
  overwritten by the visitors preferences (if any given)
+ added preferences tab (and page, of course ;) to allow the visitor to select
  the language and template set (S)HE likes
* made the installation instructions more detailed
* switched to UTF-8 for HTML encoding to support non-Latin1 languages
+ added documentation on localization (see install/README)
+ added Russian localization (ah, that's what we needed UTF-8 for ;)

v0.1.2 (28.06.2004)
-------------------
+ added the Aqua template set
+ dive details can now contain fotos
+ web site name (for the window title) can now be configured
+ now site page can contain fotos, too
* some HTML and CSS updates to the templates - M$IE needed them
* updated documentation (install/README and install/INSTALL files)
+ if there are fotos available for a dive[site], this is now indicated by a
  camera symbol in the dive[site] list

v0.1.1 (23.06.2004)
-------------------
+ all data are now retrieved from the (CSV) data files (thanks to the
  new conduit provided by Stephan), making the *.html files obsolete
* new conduit data providing us with the site_id now - so we use this for
  reference
+ logbook list and entry now provide direct link to dive site details
+ site list now supports the display limit setting
+ time in the schedule (if available) is now correctly formated
* moved the icon definitions into the templates (HTML2HTML ;)
* moved hardcoded fieldnames out of templates (for later translation)

v0.1.0 (10.06.2004)
-------------------
* initial release
